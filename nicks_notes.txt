Current challenge:
Trying to pull notes information for patients
I have a csv of all notes data, and a server of notes data
Note data consists of discharge summaries and others
    - the discharge summaries cannot be used as they contain expiration info

I have a list of ids that the current interpolation network is using, I want to match these ids with the notes to make training easy
I should consider using a bigram for TF-IDF to preserve meaning

Using chartdate vs charttime for hour look ahead calculations
    - all have chartdates, some don't have charttimes
Some patients don't have any notes???
